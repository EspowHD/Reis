Social media/networking app focused around creators for them to tell a story for their projects and showing the process behind pieces of work rather than just the finished product. The idea of the app if for creators to get more outreach and to give followers more often ongoing updates rather than just large updates on each finished project. It will also create the opportunity for the audience to engage with the creatorâ€™s creative process and to create a community based around a creators art. It will allow the user to tailor the app to their needs be it to discover new projects and creators or to simply be shown the content they have already subscribed to with no added fluff. There will also be a wellbeing aspect to encourage the user to take time off and for it to be a tool for the user rather than be something that they are addicted to.
